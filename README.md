# FrFT Guided VG
The codes for the paper titled "Fractional Fourier-Guided Visibility Graphs" which is submitted to IEEE Signal Processing Letters (SPL).

For generating and saving the FrFT-guided visibility graphs (VGs) with any FrFT order (including 0, 1, and unweighted cases), refer to codes `frft_guided_nvg_generate.py`.

For classifying the saved graphs, refer to codes `frft_guided_nvg_classify.py`.

For learning the best order for the FrFT guided VGs and performing classification, refer to codes `learnable_frft_guided_nvg`.
